    "# Generating Safer Workout Routes At Night\n",
    "\n",
    "By Mina Negahban\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the many dangers associated with running at night, 68% of people do so regularly<sup>(1)</sup>. One of the challenges during a run is staying focused -- fears of what could be hiding in the dark can be distracting, and ultimately decrease one's performance. Running should not be stressful or fear inducing, it should be relaxing, or at the very least a time when you can focus completley on your self and your fitness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal with this project is to generate safer routes for runners (or anyone out at night). The route will be optimized based on streetlight locations using Kinetica’s graph solver, to produce the most well lit path between the user’s specified origin and destination points. "

    "Below is a before and after of the generated path based on the weights. The first image is the actual shortest path, with uniform weights set to 2 (``\"uniform_weights\": \"2\"``) during the time of graph solving. The second image is the generated safest path, with no changes to the weight expression already inputted during the graph creation, to account for the presence of lights on the streets. The shortest path has 32.44 lights/km, while the safest has 32.83 lights/km. This difference is small, however it could be because the distance this example spans is very short. In the next example, the difference in light/km ratio between the two paths is larger, and spans a greater distance."

    "Here is another example of the difference in routing based on the weights. The image below depicts 2 routes from Howard Plaza Towers to Dupont Circle layered on top of our light mask we created earlier. The blue path is the actual shortest path, with uniform weights set to 2 as in the previous example. The green path is the most lit path using our custom weight expression. The blue path has 24 lights/km, while the green has 39 lights/km. This difference is much greater than the previous example, and may be due to the longer distance covered. The green path is longer than the blue by .21 km, however it has 15 more lights/km, which shows that our model is successful in prioritizing safety and litness over distance. \n",
